# Week 1 - AI-Based Air Quality Prediction and Health Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Environmental Monitoring & Pollution Control theme.  
The aim is to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) or PM2.5 levels using historical air quality and weather data for major Indian cities, and to classify health risks based on predicted air quality.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Air Quality Data in India (2015–2020) - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india)
- Contains PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃ concentrations and meteorological parameters.

## Objectives
- Predict AQI or PM2.5 using ML algorithms.
- Visualize pollution trends city-wise and over time.
- Classify air quality into health risk levels.

## Current Progress (Week 1)
- Project title finalized
- Dataset selected and uploaded to project folder in Google Drive
- Colab notebook created for:
  - Data loading
  - Basic exploration (info, missing values, description)
  - Workflow planning

## Planned Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model training and testing (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
4. Evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and classification metrics
5. (Optional) Streamlit dashboard for deployment

## Tools & Libraries
- Google Colab (Python environment)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
